In the `pictures` folder, place identically-named `.txt` and `.jpg`/`.png`/`.jpeg` files (e.g. `Frodo.jpg` and `Frodo.txt`).

The `.txt` file contains the following lines:
1. Name
2. Position
3. Description

The pictures in that folder are matched to the files & served.  Reload the page if the `.txt` files change.
